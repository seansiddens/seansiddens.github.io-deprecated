Our world is completely reliant on software. Many of our most critical systems, from airplane navigation to power plant shutdown procedures, are completely automated by software. Code is the backbone of the world’s economy: processing trillions of transactions per day and powering many of the world’s most profitable platforms. This time in history, the information age, is defined by the rapid and complete takeover of software over the last few decades. Furthermore, this takeover is showing no signs of slowing down. Software is only going to get bigger and control more of our world as time goes on. However, the quality of the software ruling our world is, in many cases, terrible, and it only seems to be getting worse.
